Establishing Database Connection:

The code begins by defining a connectionString variable that holds the necessary connection information (server, port, database name, username, and password) for connecting to a MySQL database.
Main Function:

The Main function is the entry point of the program.
It starts by attempting to establish a connection to the MySQL database using the provided connection string.
If the connection is successful, it displays a success message; otherwise, it displays an error message.
Menu Options:

The program then enters a loop where it presents a menu of options to the user and performs actions based on their input.
The available options are:
Add Employee: Allows the user to input details such as first name, last name, birth date, employee ID, employee write-ups, hours worked, time off, sales made, and starting date. The program then inserts the employee record into the "employees" table of the database.
View Employees: Retrieves and displays all employee records from the "employees" table.
Update Employee: Prompts the user to enter the ID of the employee to update and their new last name. The program then updates the corresponding employee record in the "employees" table.
Delete Employee: Prompts the user to enter the ID of the employee to delete. The program then removes the corresponding employee record from the "employees" table.
Add Manager: Allows the user to input details such as first name, last name, starting date, management department, salary, and employee ID. The program then inserts the manager record into the "management" table of the database.
AddEmployee Function:

Prompts the user to enter details for a new employee, such as first name, last name, birth date, employee ID, employee write-ups, hours worked, time off, sales made, and starting date.
It then establishes a connection to the database and executes an INSERT query to add the employee record to the "employees" table.
ViewEmployees Function:

Establishes a connection to the database and executes a SELECT query to retrieve all employee records from the "employees" table.
It then iterates over the result set and displays each employee's information on the console.
UpdateEmployee Function:

Prompts the user to enter the ID of the employee to update and their new last name.
Establishes a connection to the database and executes an UPDATE query to modify the corresponding employee record in the "employees" table.
DeleteEmployee Function:

Prompts the user to enter the ID of the employee to delete.
Establishes a connection to the database and executes a DELETE query to remove the corresponding employee record from the "employees" table.
AddManager Function:

Prompts the user to enter details for a new manager, such as first name, last name, starting date, management department, salary, and employee ID.
It then establishes a connection to the database and executes an INSERT query to add the manager record to the "management" table.
